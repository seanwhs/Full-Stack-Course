# 🧭 9:00 – Orientation: Resetting Their Thinking

## Slide – Welcome to the Bootcamp

Say this clearly:

> This is not a tutorial.
> This is a career transition.

Explain:

* High intensity
* Daily build mindset
* Comfort with confusion

---

## Activity – “How Does Instagram Work?”

Ask them:
When you post a photo:

* Where is it stored?
* How do others see it?
* What happens when someone likes it?

Let them struggle.

Then say:

> Today, we begin answering that.

---

# 🌍 9:30 – How the Web Actually Works

---

## Slide – What Happens When You Type google.com?

Walk through:

1. DNS lookup
2. Server connection
3. HTTP request
4. Server response
5. Browser rendering

Draw it live.

---

## Live Demo – Browser DevTools

Open:

* Network tab
* Refresh page
* Show requests

Explain:

* Every click = request
* The web is communication

This moment changes perspective.

---

## Key Concept

The web is:

Client ⇄ Server
Request ⇄ Response

Repeat this multiple times.

---

# 🏗 10:45 – HTML & Browser Fundamentals

---

## Slide – HTML Is Structure

Explain:

* HTML creates the document structure
* Browser converts it into DOM tree

Draw DOM tree.

---

## Guided Lab – View Page Source

Students:

* Open any website
* Right click → View Source

Let them see:
“It’s just text.”

Demystify the web.

---

## Mini Exercise

Give them:

```html
<h1>Hello Bootcamp</h1>
<p>This is my first webpage.</p>
```

Ask:
What will browser render?

They should visualize output before running it.

Train predictive thinking.

---

## Teaching Point

HTML answers:
What exists on the page?

Not:
How it looks
Not:
How it behaves

---

# 🎨 1:00 – CSS & Layout Thinking

---

## Slide – Why CSS Exists

Without CSS:
Everything stacks vertically.

CSS introduces:

* Layout
* Alignment
* Design systems

---

## Concept – Box Model

Explain:

Every element is a box.

Content
Padding
Border
Margin

Most beginner layout confusion = box model misunderstanding.

---

## Concept – Modern Layout

Introduce:

* Flexbox
* Responsive design

No syntax deep dive.

Focus on:
Layout is intentional, not accidental.

---

## Interactive Discussion

Ask:
Why must websites work on mobile?

Introduce:
Responsive design mindset.

---

# ⚡ 2:00 – JavaScript (Conceptual Only)

---

## Slide – Why JavaScript Exists

Without JS:

* No dropdown menus
* No dynamic updates
* No login validation
* No SPA apps

JavaScript enables interaction.

---

## Show Simple Example (Conceptual)

Button click → alert
Form submit → validation

Explain:

JS manipulates the DOM.

---

## Critical Mental Model

HTML = Structure
CSS = Presentation
JS = Behavior

Together = Frontend

---

# 🔗 3:15 – Architecture & APIs

This is where bootcamp mindset shifts.

---

## Slide – Static vs Dynamic

Static:

* Brochure site

Dynamic:

* Login
* Dashboard
* Database

Ask:
Is Shopee static or dynamic?

Let them answer.

---

## Slide – Three Layer Architecture

Presentation Layer
Logic Layer
Data Layer

Draw:

Browser
⬇
Backend
⬇
Database

---

## Slide – What Is an API?

API is a contract.

Frontend:
“I need user data.”

Backend:
“Here it is.”

Usually JSON.

---

## Live Demo – Network Tab Again

Trigger:
Login form or API call

Show:

* Request payload
* Response data

This makes API real.

---

# 🧠 4:15 – System Thinking Workshop

This is the most important session.

---

## Group Activity – Design a Food Delivery App

In groups, answer:

When user clicks “Order”:

1. What happens in frontend?
2. What happens in backend?
3. What happens in database?
4. What response is returned?

They must describe data flow.

Walk around and challenge assumptions.

---

## Debrief

Correct model:

User → Frontend → API → Backend → Database → Response → UI update

This loop is everything.

---

# 🧩 5:00 – Mindset Reset

---

## Slide – What You Learned Today

Not syntax.

You learned:

* How the web works
* Architecture thinking
* Data flow
* System layering

---

## Slide – The Bootcamp Promise

If you understand the flow,
You can learn any stack.

Because frameworks change.

Architecture doesn’t.

---

# 🎯 Homework (Critical)

1. Inspect 3 websites using DevTools
2. Draw architecture diagram for:

   * Instagram
   * Banking app
   * E-commerce store
3. Write explanation:
   “What happens when I log in?”

This builds mental muscle.

---

# 💡 Instructor Notes (Important for Delivery)

Do:

* Draw everything
* Ask questions constantly
* Make them explain concepts back
* Use real world examples

Avoid:

* Deep code explanation
* Syntax overload
* Framework discussions

Day 1 = Big Picture.

---

# 🧠 Psychological Design of Day 1

Students should leave thinking:

“I didn’t learn much code…
But I finally understand what’s going on.”

That confidence shift is critical.
