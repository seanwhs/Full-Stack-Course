# ⚛ 5-Day React Bootcamp

## From Components to Dynamic UIs

**Prerequisites:**

* HTML & CSS mastery
* JS fundamentals, DOM manipulation, fetch API
* Python backend logic for later API integration

**Learning Philosophy:**

* React = **component-driven UI**
* Emphasize **state, props, and unidirectional data flow**
* Build maintainable, modular frontend architecture
* Prepare for integration with Django REST API

**Format:** ~8 hours/day

* 30% lecture/concept
* 60% guided coding
* 10% reflection/code critique

# 🧱 DAY 20 – React Fundamentals & JSX

**Objectives:**

* Understand React library philosophy
* Learn JSX syntax
* Build first functional components

**Morning (9:00–12:00):**

* What is React? Component-based architecture
* Why React over vanilla JS?
* Create-react-app / Vite setup
* JSX syntax: HTML + JS expressions
* Rendering components with `ReactDOM.render`

**Afternoon (1:00–5:00):**

* Functional components: `function Header() { return (...) }`
* Component tree hierarchy
* Guided Lab:

  * Build static homepage components: Header, Footer, Hero section
  * Nest components properly

**Homework:**

* Refactor HTML multi-page site into a React component tree (static only)

---

# 🧱 DAY 21 – State & Props

**Objectives:**

* Manage component state
* Pass data between components
* Understand unidirectional data flow

**Morning:**

* `useState` hook: initialize, update, render
* Updating UI dynamically based on state
* Props: passing data from parent → child

**Afternoon:**

* Guided Lab: Counter app / toggle visibility app
* Build dynamic profile card: name, skills list updated by props
* Discuss state vs props differences

**Homework:**

* Convert to-do list from JS bootcamp into React functional components using state

---

# 🧱 DAY 22 – Event Handling & Forms

**Objectives:**

* Capture user input
* Update state on events
* Build interactive forms

**Morning:**

* React events: `onClick`, `onChange`, `onSubmit`
* Controlled components: input, textarea, select
* Form submission handling

**Afternoon:**

* Guided Lab:

  * Interactive form: add tasks to list dynamically
  * Validation: required fields, input length
  * Button disables when input empty

**Homework:**

* Build a contact form React component with local state validation

---

# 🧱 DAY 23 – Lists, Conditional Rendering & API Integration

**Objectives:**

* Render dynamic lists
* Conditionally render components
* Fetch and display data from APIs

**Morning:**

* `map()` to render lists
* Keys in lists
* Conditional rendering: ternary, logical `&&`

**Afternoon:**

* Fetch API with `useEffect`
* Display data dynamically in components
* Guided Lab:

  * Fetch JSON data (blog posts / tasks) from local Python server or placeholder API
  * Render posts as cards
  * Add “loading” and “error” states

**Homework:**

* Enhance dynamic dashboard: conditional states for empty data, error messages

---

# 🧱 DAY 24 – Mini Project & Component Architecture

**Objectives:**

* Integrate all React concepts
* Build a maintainable, component-based app
* Connect CSS styling confidently

**Morning:**

* Plan project: Task tracker, Blog dashboard, or Portfolio app
* Design component hierarchy
* Break UI into reusable components

**Afternoon:**

* Implement features incrementally:

  * State management for tasks/posts
  * Dynamic lists
  * Form submission
  * Conditional rendering
* Style with CSS modules or inline styles
* Peer code review and refactoring

**Outcome:**

* Students leave with a fully interactive React application
* Confident with components, state, props, events, API integration
* Ready for **Django backend integration**

# 🧠 Why React Bootcamp Comes After JS & Before Django

* Students already understand JS, DOM, and fetch API
* They can immediately apply React for dynamic UI
* Prepares mental model for connecting frontend to backend APIs
* Ensures modular, maintainable, production-ready frontend
